# Citrix Optimizer template directory
Any special Citrix Optimizer templates that should be run at the sealing of the base image should be placed in this folder. Only add customizations that can be used across all versions of Windows and that should always run regardless. 

By default the script will use the built in Citrix templates that come with Citrix Optimizer based on Operating System. This will be extra.
